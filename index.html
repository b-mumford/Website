                <p>The revolutionary Psyche Mikey, pictured right, 
                    can tell you exactly that. You're not the only
                    one with dreams. You can help your furry friend to
                    become anything they desire. It all starts here.

        <em>This place is actually legit. I walk in with my guinea pig and I see a 
            dog sitting there with a crystal ball. Seriously? I thought the
            picture on their webpage was just a really good disguise. I sigh and set
            my money and guinea pig on table in front of "Mikey", thinking how is this is 
            supposed to work. Next thing I know I'm at home, the music is blasting,
            and Guster the Guinea is rocking a mohawk and a mustache. I have no idea what 
            just happened, but if that experience isn't worth 20 dollars what is? 5 stars.
